### Hi, I'm Salih or as my friends call me -Mr.Sparrow  🏴‍☠️

I’m a Ruby newbie developer, cellist, professional jiu-jitsu fighter and yes, a huge cat lover🐱‍👓. I have worked in 3 countries so far as a Software/IT Support Engineer. I have so many ideas and projects that will help the Earth to become a better place for us and other livings.

- 🤓    I’m currently learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
- 💬    Ask me about OS troubleshooting(Linux/Unix and Windows), HTML, CSS, JS, Databases and of course MUSIC.
- 😄    Pronouns: he/him or ALIEN 👽
- 🚴🏽‍♀️  Fun fact: I love MUSIC, FINE ARTS and MARTIAL ARTS and I'm currently trying to learn KRAV MAGA online(I wish I could find a partner to practice at home 🏠
